## Introducing Octoburn


Octoburn is a blogging engine for
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) pages based on 
[Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress).

### Octoburn:

* uses a set of [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) grids for universal design;
* uses [Vertical Rhythm](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/typography/vertical_rhythm/) for readability;
* incorporates [microdata](http://schema.org/) in its markup to expose your brilliant ideas to search engines, the best kind of SEO;
* has built-in support for tags;
* and follows the philosophy of convention over configuration.
