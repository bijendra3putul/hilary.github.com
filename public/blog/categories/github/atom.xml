    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TL;DR While the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">Octopress instructions</a> for deploying an
Octopress blog on Github are generally quite straightforward,
some confusion over the repository name seems fairly common.
I ran into it myself. Hopefully this post can spare some
other folks hours of research and head-scratching.<!--more--></p>

<h2>repository name</h2>

<h3>personal Octopress blogs use eponymous repositories</h3>

<p>For a personal Octopress blog, you <strong>must</strong> use
<code>&lt;username&gt;.github.com</code> (where <code>&lt;username&gt;</code> is your github username)
as the name of the repository you create on Github:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/github_form.png" title="Creating a User Octopress Repository on Github" alt="A screenshot of the form for creating a repository on Github, showing hilary.github.com entered in the new repository name field."></p>

<p>From the Github Pages Guide to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages">User, Organization and Project Pages</a> we
learn that you can only use your full username, anything else will not work.</p>

<h3>project Octopress blogs use their own repositories</h3>

<p>Do not create a new repository for a project Octopress blog! The blog
lives in a branch of the project repository called <code>gh-pages</code> which is
created by the <code>rake setup_github_pages</code> command.</p>

<h2>repository url</h2>

<p>The next stumbling block came for me when I ran <code>bin/rake setup_github_pages</code>.
Having learned from my last mistake, I was determined to take the instructions
more literally. (You can see where this story is going, right? Right?)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/bin_rake_setup_first.png" title="Invoking rake setup_github_pages" alt="A screenshot of an emacs shell window. Rake has been invoked on setup_github_pages and has asked: Enter the read%2Fwrite url for your repository. For example, git%40github.com:your_username%2Fyour_username.github.com"></p>

<p>Hmmmm.... HMMMMMMMM.... Check the repo on github. The read/write access url
is <code>git@github.com:hilary/hilary.github.com.git</code>. Argh! Now what do I do?
Follow the instructions or the example? I chose incorrectly, and followed
the instructions. Don't do that. Follow the example. Leave off the <code>.git</code>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/bin_rake_setup_github.png" title="Invoking rake setup_github_pages correctly" alt="Another screenshot of the same emacs shell. git%40github.com:hilary%2Fhilary.github.com has been entered in response to the prompt"></p>

<h2>anything else?</h2>

<p>I also got my git branches rather tangled and had to untangle them. I
broke those notes off into a separate post (underway). In part, it
seems a little less common of an Octopress noob problem. Mostly,
though, I learned a lot from the experience, and am learning more from
doing an in-depth write-up.</p>

<p>Having Octopress setup problems you haven't solved? Leave a comment and I'll
look over your virtual shoulder and see if I can help.</p>
