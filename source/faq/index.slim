  | Over the past few years, as I decided to return to industry, then formed and
    followed a plan to effect that return, certain questions arose frequently. 
    Addressing those questions here struck me as efficient.

h3#why-leave-academe Why leave academe?

p 
  | I love to code. I'm one of those folks who would happily code 12 to 14 
    hours per day (or more!) if she didn't understand, at a visceral level,
    that creativity and code quality take a major hit if one spends more than
    8 or 9 hours per day, on average, coding over the long-term. Creativity
    and quality are an inextricable part of coding for me; I don't code simply
    for my own pleasure but also to facilitate how others live and work.

p 
  | I came to understand a simple truth; that writing beautiful, useful code 
    is not one of the duties of a member of the computing faculty. If a person
    loves and excels at a highly valued skill and has a job that does not
    include that skill in their responsibilities, they may be in the wrong job.
    I have other skills that won me tenure, but what I love *most* is coding.
    Continuing as faculty would have eventually extracted a high price on one
    front, the other, or most likely both.

h3#why-a-job Why a job rather than consulting?

p 
  | The answer to this question is much the same as why leave academe. Operating
    as an independent consultant means spending much of one's time in arenas I
    am happy to leave to others. I feel the same way about management positions.
    I have a lot of 'soft skills'; they make me a better software architect.

h3#why-consult-now Why are you consulting now?

p 
  | In late fall 2011, I decided to migrate from perl to Ruby. Having migrated 
    principal language several times in the past, I am well aware what is 
    involved. In addition, this time I would be making that transition largely
    solo. The coding clan I came up with are scattered all over the globe. We
    stay in touch, but it isn't the same as getting together and hacking several
    times each week. I gave myself a year for the transition. Having consulted
    in the past, I went back to a light consulting schedule in order to have
    some income.
