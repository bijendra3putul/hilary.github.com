                  analysis system), this engine is currently being
                  constructed and tested. ALIAS is limited to the
                  translation and scale-invariant detection of
                  anomalies. Future enhancements will include
                  rotational invariance as well as the automatic
                  classification of images. An experiment with
                  unsupervised learning indicates excellent detection
                  of anomalies which are square sections of the image
                  shifted horizontally or vertically with respect to
                  the original image. Supervised learning, to be
                  implemented in the near future, will allow ALIAS to
                  be conditioned to accept or reject specific
                  anomalous features (either normal or abnormal), as
                  appropriate}

                  Artificial Intelligence is a hierarchical network of
                  cellular automata which acquire their knowledge
                  through learning based on a series of
                  trial-and-error interactions with an evaluating
                  Environment, much as humans do. The input to the
                  hierarchical network is provided by a set of sensors
                  which perceive the external world. Based upon this
                  perceived information and past experience (memory),
                  the learning automata synthesize collections of
                  trial responses. Periodically the automata estimate
                  the effectiveness of these collections using either
                  internal evaluations (unsupervised learning) or
                  external evaluations from the Environment
                  (supervised learning), modifying their memories
                  accordingly. Known as Collective Learning Systems
                  Theory, this paradigm has been applied to many
                  sophisticated gaming problems, demonstrating robust
                  learning and dynamic adaptivity. Based on a
                  versatile architecture for massively parallel
                  networks of processors for Collective Learning
                  Systems, a Transputer-based parallel-processing
                  image processing engine comprising 32 learning cells
                  and 32 non-learning cells has been applied to a

                  of anomalous features in otherwise ``normal''
                  images. In cooperation with Robert Bosch GmbH, this
                  engine is currently being constructed and tested
                  under the direction of the author at the Research
                  Institute for Applied Knowledge Processing (FAW-Ulm)

                  discriminatory power in terms of a particular
                  classifier. Non-parametric discriminately power
                  allows feature selection to be based on the

                  requirements of any one classifier. In previous

                  non-parametric discriminatory power called relative
                  feature importance (RFI). In this work, we explore
                  the construction of RFI through closed-form analysis

                  thinking about and teaching CRM.We introduce a novel
                  sense-making structure for teaching CRM. That
                  structure consists of a road map to the CRM
                  literature, a framework grounded in questions rather
                  than answers, and two CRM skill sets: core skills
                  and specific skills. We integrate our structure with
                  a model for the process a learner goes through on
                  the way to becoming an expert computing researcher
                  and offer example learning activities that represent
                  a growing repository of course materials meant to
                  aid those wishing to teach research skills to
                  computing students.Our model is designed to ground
                  discussion of teaching CRM and to serve as a roadmap
                  for institutions, faculty, students and research
                  communities addressing the transition from student
                  to fully enfranchised member of a computing research
                  community of practice. To that end, we offer several
                  possible scenarios for using our model.In computing,
                  research methods have traditionally been passed from
                  advisor to student via apprenticeship. Establishing
                  a richer pedagogy for training researchers in
                  computing will benefit all (see Figure 1).},
